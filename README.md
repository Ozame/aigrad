## Artificial General Intelligence - a systematic mapping study

### Abstract 

The research field of artificial general intelligence is growing more popular
in recent years, but it is complex and fragmented, and therefore difficult to
enter for the new researchers. In this thesis, a systematic mapping study was
conducted on the field of artificial general intelligence. The goal of the
study was to gain insight about the recent developments in the study field,
and achieve an overview of the area. In the study there were 92 accepted
articles from years 2015-2019 from five different publication forums. Key
findings show small but steady amount of researched being published yearly,
with focus on novel solution proposals and philosophical papers. Most popular
research topics are cognitive architectures, theory of universal AI, AI safety and
ethics, and different types of learning methods. Most of the AGI research is
conducted in European countries but USA is, by considerable margin, the most
active country in the research.
