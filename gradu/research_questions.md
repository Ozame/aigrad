# Research question proposition
*Author Samu Kumpulainen*

## Possible research Questions (?)
1. **How much, and what type of research is done in the field of AGI?**
      - What is the current state of AGI research? -> How much research is done in recent years? What is the overall trend (interest growth/decline)? 
      - What type of research it is (research methods, types)
2.  **Where is the AGI research focused on?**
    - This includes
       - topics
       - techniques
       - technology
    - What are the current techniques (and topics) used and researched?
    - How the research is focused on the field? 
    - *(How it has changed over time? Can this be observed on such short time)*
3. **Has there been any major breakthroughs?**
    - What have been the most successful attempts?
4. **Where and when were the studies published?**
    - Time
    - Journal


## Keywords picked from the research questions

- artificial intelligence, AI
- general artificial intelligence & artificial general intelligence, AGI
- success, advances, development, breakthrough

- The search needs to be limited to software engineering/computer science because often search attempts with abbreviation AGI would result in chemistry/physics related paper about AgI-compounds.
  - This could be accomplished with terms:
    - software engineering, computer (science), artificial intelligence

### Possible relating keywords
- superintelligence
- strong ai
- turing test
