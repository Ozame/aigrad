## Definitely included

High level and/or topical relevance make these the ideal candidates for the review.

Issues are looked only on years 2015-2019

- 3 ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE | citescore 7.7 | Impact factor 6.628
  - Issues 218-277 = 59, articles in issue ~ 10,
- 3 JOURNAL OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE RESEARCH | IF 1.8
  - Issues 52-66 = 14, articles in issue ~20
- 1 JOURNAL OF ARTIFICIAL GENERAL INTELLIGENCE
  - Issues = 6, articles in issue ~ 2

### Conference proceedings
- INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ARTIFICIAL GENERAL INTELLIGENCE
  - Issues = 5, articles in issue ~ 30
  - This conference seems to be suprisingly active and on topic
  - Not in JUFO rankings
  
- (1 EUROPEAN SYMPOSIUM ON ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORKS, COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND MACHINE LEARNING)
  - This would increase article load with 500+ articles, with a low number of relevant papers. So maybe?


==> In total, around 1000 articles concerning AI. Quick sampling shows the number of actually relevant articles may still be very low.


## Not sure

These could be okay, but not low level + questionable relevance make them far from ideal.
