# Systematic literature mapping - AGI

This document describes the process of systematic mapping. Notes, decision
descriptions etc. will be stored here during the study.

- As search is performed within journal/conference issues, missing papers in
  sense is not possible, if the issues truly cover the field (wohlin samplesize)
- If initial papers from journals are searched automatically instead of manual
  search, missing papers is possible.

## Research questions
- Derived from the research goal: Overview of the field.
- Using PICO here might help? 

## Search 

- Might have to use combination of manual and automatic search, 
  as searching through all material by hand is not feasible, but also might not be possible to find everything by automatic searches.

### How to search different venues

#### Artificial Intelligence
- https://www.journals.elsevier.com/artificial-intelligence/
- https://www-sciencedirect-com.ezproxy.jyu.fi/journal/artificial-intelligence

- Either use search on above link, or limit scopus there:
  - https://www-scopus-com.ezproxy.jyu.fi/results/results.uri?sort=plf-f&src=s&nlo=&nlr=&nls=&sid=2924507b14c32f4fb64d46114d17cf1a&sot=a&sdt=cl&cluster=scoexactsrctitle%2c%22Artificial+Intelligence%22%2ct&sl=17&s=SOURCE-ID+%2823675%29&origin=resultslist&zone=leftSideBar&editSaveSearch=&txGid=e389835a97e9acafe2c9e8543eaa4fe1
- Automatic search should be performed, is viable

#### Journal of artificial intelligence research
- https://www.jair.org/index.php/jair
- scopus: https://www-scopus-com.ezproxy.jyu.fi/sourceid/24330?origin=resultslist

- Scopus search possible, doable manually but would be easier

#### Journal of artificial general intelligence
- https://content.sciendo.com/view/journals/jagi/jagi-overview.xml?language=en

- Very little material, manual search preferred

#### International conference on artificial general intelligence
- https://link-springer-com.ezproxy.jyu.fi/conference/agi 
- Many papers, manual search viable, automatic good as well (springer)

#### International joint conference on artificial intelligence
- scopus https://www-scopus-com.ezproxy.jyu.fi/results/results.uri?sort=plf-f&src=s&st1=International+joint+conference+on+artificial+intelligence&nlo=&nlr=&nls=&sid=a09ad57cfa20f5f9c12f2be1afbe370a&sot=b&sdt=cl&cluster=scoexactsrctitle%2c%22Ijcai+International+Joint+Conference+On+Artificial+Intelligence%22%2ct&sl=67&s=SRCTITLE%28International+joint+conference+on+artificial+intelligence%29&origin=resultslist&zone=leftSideBar&editSaveSearch=&txGid=b1a476ec5cf5e0fa8ebb000d88c5fe3b

- automatic search via scopus. Very little articles of interest

##### See search results in the excel files 

- Need to justify the journal choice in general, why not just do the general search?
- Focusing only on the most relevant journals, as the goal is to map the AGI not
  it's relation to the other ai research (altho this is a plus)
- Target papers are topically relevant and high ranking.
- AIJ, JAIR, IJCAI were possible to search through via scopus, JAGI manually,
  ICAGI with springer 
    - TODO: Get exact internal search strings (at least from scopus)

  **Excel files:**
  - search_terms = preliminary search term testing on different databases.
  - material_search = Scopus and sciendo papers.
  - ICAGI = ICAGI conference papers exported via proquest, only names and links
  - scopus_ai_jair_ijcai = Aforementioned articles, exported from scopus, good info
  - articles_combined = results from the scraping script, which gets more info
    on the papers from their springer-link pages. Also other papers 
    **!PRONE TO CHANGE!**
  - final_results = the working file, should be kept clean and safe. Has all the
    articles and will be used in the mapping process.


- **Should cognitive architechture related papers be alway included?**
  - Many such papers don't always directly mention AGI or HLAI, but are still related in a way... E.g. Micropsi, and especially OpenCog. 

###### Terms mentioned often, possible keywords
- Symbolic/subsymbolic 
- Cognitive architectures
- NARS
- OpenCog
- AGI safety
- AIXI?
- Universal induction & Solomonoff induction 


Initial search yielded total of 187 papers. After first phase of inspection, 122 were considered potential. They were further examined in the second phase, where the inclusion criteria was further considered.
